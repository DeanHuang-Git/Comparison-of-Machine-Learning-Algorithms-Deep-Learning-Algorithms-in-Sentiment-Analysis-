# Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithm and Deep
Learning Algorithm in Sentiment Analysis Task

## Abstract
The goal of our study is to provide a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of several state-
of-the-art machine-learning methods as well as deep learning algorithms for the automated
classification of sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis algorithms we are evaluating and
comparing are logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors algorithm, random forest, fasText, Long
short-term memory (LSTM), Attention-Based BiLSTM, and CNN. To compare the performance
of these methods, we will use the Yelp dataset provided by Kaggle [1] to perform sentiment
analysis on the user reviews.
